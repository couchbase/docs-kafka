= Couchbase Capella Support
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Connecting to Couchbase Capella is very similar to connecting to any Couchbase cluster over an encrypted connection.
This section explains how.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must use a Kafka connector version of *4.0.1 or higher*.
Earlier versions will not work.
====


== Before You Start

Make sure your Capella cluster is configured to allow connections from the IP addresses of all computers running the connector.

You will need the credentials of a Capella database user with read (or read/write) permission.

You will need to know which version of the connector you are using, so you can follow the instructions for that version.

[[configure-4.1.7]]
== Configuring Version 4.1.7 and Later

With this version of the connector, connecting to Capella is simple.
All you need to do is enable TLS by setting the `couchbase.enable.tls` connector config property to true.

The Capella Certificate Authority (CA) certificate bundled with the connector is trusted by default. You can skip the rest of this page, or continue reading to learn how to configure the connector to trust a different CA certificate.

[[certificate-download]]
== Certificate Download

Once you have created a Cluster in Couchbase Capella, navigate to the `Connect` tab and download the security certificate.

Rename the downloaded file to `couchbase.pem`.
(The name doesn't really matter, but the rest of this guide refers to the Couchbase certificate file by that name.)

[#connector-config]
== Configuring Version 4.0.5 and Later

Enable TLS by setting `*couchbase.enable.tls*` to `true`.

Set the `*couchbase.trust.certificate.path*` property to the absolute filesystem path to `couchbase.pem`.

Now you're ready to connect to your Couchbase Capella cluster.

TIP: Alternatively, you can put the certificate in a trust store as decribed in the next section.

[#trust-store]
== Configuring Earlier Versions

Prior to connector version 4.0.5, the certificate must live in a trust store.

=== Add the certificate to a trust store

The connector's trust store is a Java keystore file containing the certificates the connector should trust.
We'll use the Java `keytool` command to create a keystore and populate it with the root certificates for Couchbase Capella.

To add the Couchbase Capella root certificate:

[source]
----
$ keytool -importcert -keystore truststore.jks -file couchbase.pem
----
If the keystore file `truststore.jks` does not yet exist, you will be prompted to choose a password for the new keystore.
Otherwise, you will be prompted for the password of the existing keystore.

You will then be presented with a summary of the information in the certificate, and asked if you want to trust the certificate.
If the information is correct, enter `y` to confirm.

You can verify that it has been stored with `keytool -list`:

[source]
----
$ keytool -list
Enter keystore password:
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry
----

=== Configure the connector to use a trust store

Now that you have a trust store containing the Capella certificate, the last step is to configure the connector to use it for secure connections.

Enable TLS by setting `*couchbase.enable.tls*` to `true`.

Set the `*couchbase.trust.store.path*` property to the absolute filesystem path to `truststore.jks`.

Configure `*couchbase.trust.store.password*` by providing the keystore password.

Now you're ready to connect to your Couchbase Capella cluster.
