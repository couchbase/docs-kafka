= Couchbase Cloud Support
:page-topic-type: concept

[abstract]
Connecting to Couchbase Cloud is very similar to connecting to any Couchbase cluster over an encrypted connection.
This section explains how.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You must use a Kafka connector version of *4.0.1 or higher*.
Earlier versions will not work.
====

== Certificate Download

Once you have created a Cluster in Couchbase Cloud, navigate to the `Connect` tab and download the security certificate.

Rename the downloaded file to `couchbase.pem`.
(The name doesn't really matter, but the rest of this guide refers to the Couchbase certificate file by that name.)

== Add Certificate to a Trust Store

The connector's trust store is a Java keystore file containing the certificates the connector should trust.
We'll use the Java `keytool` command to create a keystore and populate it with the root certificates for Couchbase Cloud.

To add the Couchbase Cloud root certificate:

[source]
----
$ keytool -importcert -keystore truststore.jks -file couchbase.pem
----
If the keystore file `truststore.jks` does not yet exist, you will be prompted to choose a password for the new keystore.
Otherwise, you will be prompted for the password of the existing keystore.

You will then be presented with a summary of the information in the certificate, and asked if you want to trust the certificate.
If the information is correct, enter `y` to confirm.

You can verify that it has been stored with `keytool -list`:

[source]
----
$ keytool -list
Enter keystore password:
Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SUN

Your keystore contains 1 entry
----

== Connector Configuration

Now that you have a trust store containing the cloud certificate, the last step is to configure the connector to use it for secure connections.

Enable TLS by setting `*couchbase.enable.tls*` to `true`.

Set the `*couchbase.trust.store.path*` property to the absolute filesystem path to `truststore.jks`.

Configure `*couchbase.trust.store.password*` by providing the keystore password.

Now you're ready to connect to your Couchbase Cloud cluster.
