= Introduction

[abstract]
The Couchbase Kafka connector is a plug-in for the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect[Kafka Connect] framework.
It provides source and sink components.

The source connector streams documents from Couchbase Server using the high-performance Database Change Protocol (DCP) and publishes the latest version of each document to a Kafka topic in near real-time.

The sink connector subscribes to Kafka topics and writes the messages to Couchbase Server.
